          New businesses have a laser focus on serving niche customer needs and
          growing from there, finding the right partners to help provide the
          value their customers want. Legacy businesses should identify part(s)
          of their business that can hold their own (frequent or painful problem
          being solved, competitive advantage, undeveloped market, etc.).
          <br /> <br />
          Smart companies have been focusing on the client and consumer forever,
          but bloat is easy. Digital Transformation (like Automation, RPA, Lean,
          Strategic Resiliency, etc.) is mostly about companies taking another
          look at things and narrowing focus.
